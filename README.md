Thanks to [Kaitlin Salzke](https://kaitlinsalzke.com) for the inspiration for these (see the [omnifocus-scripts](https://github.com/ksalzke/omnifocus-plugins) repository)  and pointers on how to set this up. Check out [this blogpost](https://kaitlinsalzke.com/how-to/how-to-add-a-omnijs-plug-in-to-omnifocus-and-assign-a-keyboard-shortcut/) on how to set up Omni Automation in Omnifocus.
